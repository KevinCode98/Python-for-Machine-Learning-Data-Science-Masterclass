    "    * Understand NumPy\n",
    "    * Create arrays with NumPy\n",
    "    * Retrive information from a NumPy array through slicing and indexing.\n",
    "    * Learn basic NumPy operations\n",
    "    * Test NumPy skills with exercise questioins. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What is NumPy? \n",
    "    * Python library for creating N-dimensioinal arrays\n",
    "    * Ability to quickly broadcast functions\n",
    "    * Built-in linear algebra, statistical distributionsm trigonometricm and random number capabilities \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Why use NumPy?\n",
    "    * While NumPy structures look similar to standar Python list, they are **much** more efficent! \n",
    "    * The broadcasting capabilities are also extremely useful for quickly applying functions to our data sets. "
